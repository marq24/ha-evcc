            I confirm, that I did not read any of the previous bulletin-points and just checked them all. | I don't wanted to waste my time with details, I don't read or follow any existing instructions. | Instead, I want that the maintainers of this repo will spend time explaining the world to me - that's their job!. | I live by the motto: Better to ask than to think about it once. | It's the maintainers' own fault that they provide open-source software and are willing to offer free support.
